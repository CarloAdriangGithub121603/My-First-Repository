These are my favorite Quotes in the series

1. "That's The Difference Between You And Me. You Wanna Lose Small, I Wanna Win Big."
2. "I Don't Play The Odds, I Play The Man."
3. "You Don't Send A Puppy To Clean Up Its Own Mess."

Fun facts about Suits:
The role of Harvey Specter was originally written for a much older actor. However, after Gabriel Macht's audition, the creators were so impressed that they reimagined the character to fit him.
